		<h2>Numbers: Examples of 1d, 2d, 3d, ..., N-d</h2>
		<p>
		Decimal numbers can be used as examples of N-dimensional objects. Numbers 0-9 are 1d, 10-99 are 2d, 100-999 are 3d, 1000-9999 are 4d, etc. Extreme examples would be unary numbers where every dimension will have single object - 1d (.), 2d (..), 3d (...), etc. Generally we use n-tuple of numbers as examples of n-dimensional objects, e.g., (3, 2, 4) is a point in 3-d space. Here using a decimal number "324" instead has multiple benefits. It is simpler example than (3, 2, 4), it has more operations available than n-tuple etc. Using a number instead of tuple gives different aspect to look at n-dimensional object. Vector space study also can utilise numbers ranges as corresponding n-dimensional vector space.

		Using numbers it is easier to visualise n-dimensional space, because we have been familiar with numbers from very early age. For example, to think of an 4-dimensional world, we can take example of a set of numbers between 1000-9999. This 4d world has 10k points. We can visualise various operations on these points easily using basic arithmatic on numbers. Also, we are enabled to perform complex operations on the elements of our example space.
