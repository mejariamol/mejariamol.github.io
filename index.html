			<li>High level plan of the desired computation</li>
			<li>High level control flow of overall computation abstracting complex details. e.g., by introducing sub-routines etc.</li>
			<li>Decide on data structures to handle information during computation.</li>

		<h3>2. High level control flow of overall computation</h3>
		While writing high level control flow, I have experienced that it is often helpful to jump around the control flow. For example, I find it natural to jump directly to the major part(s) of the control flow in my overall computation, ignoring other insignificant details. It helps in a way, to give priority to major control flow(s) and putting other parts around it.
		</p>
		<p>
		Example of a program: If I want to do some computation X() for many combinations using some nested loops. In such case, while writing high level control flow, I will start with high level control flow of X(), leaving out complex details as sub-routines. Once control flow for X() is defined, I will start thinking how to put loops to do X() for required combinations.

		<h2>Numbers: Examples of 1d, 2d, 3d, ..., N-d</h2>
		<p>
		Decimal numbers can be used as examples of N-dimensional objects. Numbers 0-9 are 1d, 10-99 are 2d, 100-999 are 3d, 1000-9999 are 4d, etc. Extreme examples would be unary numbers where every dimension will have single object - 1d (.), 2d (..), 3d (...), etc. Generally we use n-tuple of numbers as examples of n-dimensional objects, e.g., (3, 2, 4) is a point in 3-d space. Here using a decimal number "324" instead has multiple benefits. It is simpler example than (3, 2, 4), it has more operations available than n-tuple etc. Using a number instead of tuple gives different aspect to look at n-dimensional object. Vector space study also can utilise numbers ranges as corresponding n-dimensional vector space.
		</p>
		<p>
		Using numbers it is easier to visualise n-dimensional space, because we have been familiar with numbers from very early age. For example, to think of an 4-dimensional world, we can take example of a set of numbers between 1000-9999. This 4d world has 10k points. We can visualise various operations on these points easily using basic arithmatic on numbers. Also, we are enabled to perform complex operations on the elements of our example space.
