			<li>High level plan of the desired computation</li>
			<li>High level control flow of overall computation abstracting complex details. e.g., by introducing sub-routines etc.</li>
			<li>Decide on data structures to handle information during computation.</li>
			<li>Fill in other details in overall computation.</li>
			<li>Implement sub-routines.</li>

		<h3>2. High level control flow of overall computation</h3>
		While writing high level control flow, I have experienced that it is often helpful to jump around the control flow. For<br>
		example, I find it natural to jump directly to the major part(s) of the control flow in my overall computation, ignoring<br>
		other insignificant details. It helps in a way, to give priority to major control flow(s) and putting other parts<br>
		around it.
		</p>
		<p>
		Example of a program: If I want to do some computation X() for many combinations using some nested loops. In such case,<br>
		while writing high level control flow, I will start with high level control flow of X(), leaving out complex details<br>
		as sub-routines. Once control flow for X() is defined, I will start thinking how to put loops to do X() for required<br>
		combinations.
